# Haskell To Do List TUI

This program has a TUI made in haskell that looks at current tasks based on the savefile given.

While I tried to set it up for VSCode, I only really got things going when I was working with cabal.
If editing, just keep using `cabal build` and `cabal run` to work on the project.

Otherwise, the .exe file has been copied to the top folder for your convenience.

## Note of thanks

Credits to all the online resources available on Brick, Cabal, TUI, and haskell.
There are not many, which made the few that had those resources much more valuable. 
I have a list of some of these pages I found most helpful, but I don't feel like 
transeferring the file to upload it, so reach out if you're really interested.
